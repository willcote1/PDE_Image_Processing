# PDE-Image-Processing

This project blurs images using the 2-D heat equation. On the Beatles.ppm and Love.ppm images it uses the shock filter partial differential equation to approximately reduce blurring and noise. The level set and Fatemi equations are applied for a similar goal on the tri.ppm, trilgt.ppm, trimed.ppm, trihvy.ppm, and Dobbs.ppm images. The Lovens.ppm image has a combination of the shock filter, level set, and Fatemi equations applied to most effectively reduce noise.
